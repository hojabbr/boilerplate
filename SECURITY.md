# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

To report a vulnerability:

1. **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/hojabbr/boilerplate/security/advisories/new) for this repository. This allows private discussion and disclosure when a fix is ready.
2. **Alternatively:** Contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via the contact method listed in the repository profile or in the Code of Conduct) with a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce.

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge your report and work on verifying and addressing it.
- We will keep you updated on progress and coordinate disclosure (e.g. after a patch is released).

## Supported versions

We support the **latest major version** of this boilerplate with security updates. If you are on an older fork, please consider updating to the latest release.
