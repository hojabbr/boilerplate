# Getting Started

Get the boilerplate running locally with PHP, Composer, Node, and a database (or use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail)).

- **[Installation](installation.md)** — Clone, install dependencies, and run migrations.
- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** — Environment variables and optional services (Meilisearch, Reverb, etc.).
